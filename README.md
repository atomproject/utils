# Installation

Run following commands in `git bash` to install all the scripts.

```
git clone git@github.com:atomproject/utils
cd ./utils
source ./install
```

Now all the commands are available for you to use.

# Notes

The `git checkout` doesn't trigger file system change event and because of that the files won't be copied
